What is hoisting?
Its the way that we explain how the JS complier works.
Variables are hoisted to the top of the specific code they are declared in. When using var, 
you can access the variable name and its undefined value before it is used later on.
Function declarations are also hoisted and can be invoked "before" they are defined in a codebase.
